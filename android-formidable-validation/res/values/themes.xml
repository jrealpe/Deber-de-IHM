    <!-- The default theme for apps on API level 10 and lower. This is the theme used for
         activities that have not explicitly set their own theme.
         <p>You can count on this being a dark
         background with light text on top, but should try to make no
         other assumptions about its appearance. In particular, the text
         inside of widgets using this theme may be completely different,
         with the widget container being a light color and the text on top
         of it a dark color.
         <p>If you're developing for API level 11 and higher, you should instead use {@link
         #Theme_Holo} or {@link #Theme_DeviceDefault}.</p>

    <!-- Honeycomb holographic theme (dark version).
         <p>This is the default system theme for apps that target API level 11 - 13. Starting
         with API level 14, the default system theme is supplied by {@link #Theme_DeviceDefault},
         which might apply a different style on different devices. If you want to ensure that your
         app consistenly uses the Holo theme at all times, you must explicitly declare it in your
         manifest. For example, {@code &lt;application android:theme="@android:style/Theme.Holo"&gt;}.
         For more information, read <a
         href="http://android-developers.blogspot.com/2012/01/holo-everywhere.html">Holo
         Everywhere</a>.</p>
         <p>The widgets in the holographic theme are translucent on their brackground, so
         applications must ensure that any background they use with this theme is itself
         dark; otherwise, it will be difficult to see the widgets. This UI style also includes a
         full action bar by default.</p>

         <p>Styles used by the Holo theme are named using the convention Type.Holo.Etc
         (for example, {@code Widget.Holo.Button} and {@code
         TextAppearance.Holo.Widget.PopupMenu.Large}).
         Specific resources used by Holo are named using the convention @type/foo_bar_baz_holo
         with trailing _dark or _light specifiers if they are not shared between both light and
         dark versions of the theme. -->
